## Project overview
### Project description
WorkBox is an information system designed as a microservice web application to improve the organization and management of employees within an IT company. It is a universal web application primarily focused on the IT sector but can be applied to other related industries. The system aims to improve internal communication and automate typical processes such as generating financial reports, processing work hours and organizing human resources within the company and its projects.

### System actors and business processes
The system defines 3 types of actors that are organized into 3 microservices:
1. Financial manager - an actor operating in the Financial Microservice
2. HR - actor in charge of processes in the HR Microservice
3. Business manager - in charge of processes in Business Microservice
Each microservice represents a different sector that makes up the WorkBox information system.
